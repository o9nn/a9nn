Perfect! The optimization is complete. Let me store this knowledge for future reference:

{
  "subject": "agent file optimization",
  "fact": "Agent markdown files in .github/agents/ should be under 30,000 characters each",
  "citations": "User requirement: \"optimize .github/agents/aion.md & .github/agents/nnecco.md to meet the <30k char constraint\"",
  "reason": "This constraint is important for agent file management in the repository. When creating or modifying agent files in the future, they should be optimized to stay under this limit by: condensing repetitive patterns, streamlining verbose formatting, consolidating code examples, removing excessive whitespace, and merging related sections while preserving all essential functionality. This will help with code review tasks and maintaining consistency across agent definitions.",
  "category": "general"
